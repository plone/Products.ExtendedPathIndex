2.4.1 - September 28, 2008
--------------------------

- Fix typo in setup.py which broke installation of the egg
  [ree]

  

2.4 - September 11, 2006
------------------------

- Relaxed a check for path only allowing strings so far. Now we except all
  basestrings. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5617.
  [hannosch]

- Converted log infrastructure to use Python's logging module instead zLOG.
  [hannosch] 

2.3 - December 18, 2005
-----------------------

- Added some extra debug information when an improper path is cataloged.
  [sidnei]

2.2 - October 7, 2005
---------------------

- Add seperate index structures on the parent path and the full path of all
  objects.  This significantly improves scaling for navtrees, breadcrumbs,
  and listings.
  [alecm]

- Assume that EPI is used inside same container as content and use relative
  search instead of absolute - basically transforming / plonesite search
  to / search with startlevel set to 1 instead of 0.
  [tesdal]

2.1 - May 20, 2005
------------------

- Implement 'indexed_attrs' support for ExtendedPathIndex.

- Prevent navigation tree queries from stopping prematurely if the
  queried-for path does not actually exist in the index, but its parents do.

1.0
---

- Path index capable of generating a navigation tree structure from
  cataloged data.
